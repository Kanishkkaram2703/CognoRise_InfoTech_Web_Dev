# Web Development Hackathon by CognoRise InfoTech
I recently participated in a web development hackathon organized by the CognoRise InfoTech team. The challenge was to build a fully functional gym website using any platform of our choice. For this project, I chose to utilize Wix Studio due to its versatility and ease of use.

During the hackathon, I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing website that includes essential features such as:

•Homepage: An engaging landing page with an overview of the gym's offerings.

•About Us: Information about the gym, its mission, and the team.

•Classes & Schedules: A detailed schedule of classes and programs available at the gym.

•Membership Plans: Various membership options with detailed descriptions and pricing.

•Registration Form: A streamlined process for new members to sign up.

•Packages: Different workout packages tailored to various fitness goals.

•Timings: Operating hours and class timings for easy planning.

•Offers: Special promotions and discounts for members.

•Gym Gears: Information on available gym equipment and apparel.

•Nutrition & Supplements: Guidance on dietary plans and recommended supplements.

•Contact Page: A contact form and map integration for easy location access.

I enjoyed the process of leveraging Wix Studio’s capabilities to bring the gym’s vision to life and successfully deliver a functional and aesthetically pleasing website within the given timeframe. This experience has further enhanced my skills in web development and platform-specific design.
